# spark-redis
Redis Labs recently published a spark-redis package for general public consumption. It is, as the name may suggest, a Redis connector for Apache Spark that provides read and write access to all of Redisâ€™ core data structures as RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets, in Spark terminology).
Redis Connector examples written in Scala. It stores the RDD in Redis Cache and then uses redis cache to fetch the RDD . It also contain examples to store the Dataset in Redis and fetch the DataSet from Redis. Examples are written in Scala.
